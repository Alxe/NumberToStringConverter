# NumberToStringConverter

Assignment project done for my two-year couse of "Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma" (Multiplatform Software Development).

The idea behind this code is basically a function that recieves a numeric argument and returns a textual representation of said number in a variety of languages (Only English and Spanish supported), which you used in an Android application (not present in this repository).

As I was feeling creative, I tried to develop this project with a scalable approach using object orientation. I do believe I met my intentions, but I also believe I complicated the implementation too much for such a simple task.
